## mzML Denovo Spectra Generator (DSG) ##
Description:
This tool allow to generate figures for index or XIC selected MS/MS spectra from a mzML file.
It provide options for the auto labelling of peaks and some non statistical-based De Novo sequence suggestions with the possibility to auto label the sequence selected.

Step 1:
The DSG tool can import .mzML files
This file format can be generated by vendor raw data convertors or with msConvert from ProteoWizard tools (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/tools.shtml).
WARNING: Only one .mzML file can be loaded at a time.

Step 2:
On the left you can choose either to access your spectra of interest by using the spectra index (This value can be obtained from searches results such a peptide report from Protein Pilot and X-tandem ...).
If you choose the XIC selection, a m/z value AND/OR a retention time for the expected precursor with tolerance windows will be needed to extract a list of criteria matching spectras.
To search for the matching spectra Press the "List matching spectras"
The total number of matching spectras and a listing will be outputed on the right region window.
WARNING: The desired spectra need to be selected on the right window region before further processing.

Step 3:
The peaks in the MS/MS spectra for the selected precursor will be scalled on the most intense peak to a % scale relative abundance.
You can decide to remove background noise from your MS/MS spectra for aesthetic and to help downstream interpretation by selection a % signal threeshold below which peaks will be removed.
A number of peaks for automatic m/z labelling can also be provided, this will label the N most intense peaks in the MS/MS spectra. To turn OFF this function just fill "0" in this area.

Step 4:
The display and save spectra window can be used to preview the selected MS/MS spectra for selected precursor in Step 2.
Multiple MS/MS spectra can be generated alongside each other for comparison by pressing several time "Preview".
To remove all spectras generated so far Press "Clear Preview".
The generated spectra have a set of too
WARNING: It is recommended to Clear all spectra before processing to the De novo sequencing part to free a maximum window space for good visual interpretation.
If you do not wish to generate any De novo sequencing on your selected spectra you can stop at this stage.

Step 5:
WARNING: The Optional de novo sequencing atempt to calculate possible sequences from your MS/MS spectra with a method as close as what would be performed by a human eye rather than using statistical evaluations and prediction fitting. In that regard there is no warantee that the provided possible sequences will be correct.
This tool intend to help the user make a visual interpretation of their MS/MS spectra by proposing possibilities and it is up to the user to accept that suggestion and to be critic about their spectras.
To generate possible De novo sequences, a peak intensity threeshold below which informations will be removed need to be provide (To turn OFF that option type "0" value).
A m/z error tolerance will determine the accepted mass error (plus or minus) when matching peaks to possible amino acid masses.
A minimum and maximum m/z value can be provided to restrict the spectra region to which you want to apply the de novo sequencing (to exclude particularly noisy part of your spectra that may lead to many miss interpretations).
Once the parameters are selected (also check that a spectra is selected in the Step 2 window) Press the "Get possible sequences".
Possible interpretable sequences will be outputed in the right side window
To generated a corresponding annotated sequence spectra, select a sequence in the right side window and then Press "START" button. The spectra will be generated on the Step 4 display area and can be dealt with in the exact same way at the difference that the "Preview" Button is the "Start" button for De novo selected spectra.

How is the de novo algorithm working ???:
It consider the following monoisotopic masses for each amino acids and common loss:
A : 71.03711, R : 156.10111, R-NH3 : 139.10111, N : 114.04293, N-NH3 : 97.04293, D : 115.02694, C : 103.00919, E : 129.04259, Q : 128.05858, Q-NH3 : 111.05858, G : 57.02146, H : 137.05891, I/L : 113.08406, K : 128.09496, K-NH3 : 111.09496, M : 131.04049, F : 147.06841, P : 97.05276, S : 87.03203, S-H2O : 72.03203, T : 101.04768, T-H2O : 83.04768, W : 186.07931, Y : 163.06333, V : 99.06841

The algorithm will sort the different peaks by m/z order with their corresponding intensities. It then group the peaks by increments of windows < 50 m/z from the initial position
for exemple a list of peaks m/z as follow : (100, 120, 150, 160, 180, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600, 620, 650) will be grouped in such manner ((100, 120), (150, 160, 180), (200), (250), (350), (500), (600, 620)).
Then two frames of reading will be determined by these groups,
one will keep the most intense ion in each groups, and another will keep the 2 most intense ions in each groups.
For the second serie (the one referencing the 2 most itense ions for each windows) all the different possible associations between groups will be generated. A list of groups like this one: ((100, 120), (150, 160, 180), (200), (250), (350), (500), (600, 620))
will generate an association list as follow: ((100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620), (100, 160, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (100, 160, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620), (100, 180, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (100, 180, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620), (120, 150, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (120, 150, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620), (120, 160, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (120, 160, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620), (120, 180, 200, 250, 350, 500, 600), (120, 180, 200, 250, 350, 500, 620))
Then the delta mass between each subsequent values in each association groups will be calculated as follow:
((-50, -50, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-50, -50, -50, -100, -150, -120), (-60, -40, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-60, -40, -50, -100, -150, -120), (-80, -20, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-80, -20, -50, -100, -150, -120), (-30, -50, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-30, -50, -50, -100, -150, -120), (-40, -40, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-40, -40, -50, -100, -150, -120), (-60, -20, -50, -100, -150, -100), (-60, -20, -50, -100, -150, -120))
This should represent all the possible delta masses between the 2 most intense ions in a recursive 50 m/z increment window.
Then for each absolute Delta values an amino acid Letter code will be associated if the Delta value match an amino acid mass within the m/z tolerence window.
The sequences obtained will then be sorted by size (from the longest) and outputed as possible sequences. The grouping that include only the single most intense ion for each window will generate a single possible sequence and will be outputed on the top of the list as "Best intensity Hit" and represent the sequence someone would have found by calculating possible delta masses amongts the most obvious peaks in the spectra.
Effectively this method will most likely find y ions series and will work better with a minimum amount of noise peaks thus making the noise intensity threeshold option critical and may greatly influence the result obtained.
Why 50 m/z windows ??:
The amino acids monoisotopic masses will range from a mass of roughly 57,02 for the Glycine to 186.07 for Tryptophan, to avoid the possibility of having two peaks that could have a delta mass corresponding to the lower mass amino acids in the same group thus missing their detection, the window value had to be below 57. A value of 50 was empirically choosen but may not be optimal and adjusted in the future.
Why only choosing the 2 most intense ions per group and not all ??:
The number of possible commbinaisons will exponentially increase with the number of ions choosen per groups. In a range of 250 - 1000 m/z considered this will generate 15 windows
Thus the number of possible combinaisons will be of N^15 (for comparison 2 best ions gives 32768 combinaisons where 3 best ions gives 14,348,907 combinaisons)
This method of detection is by no mean perfect and two points need to be taken into consideration for interpretation and further improvment:
1) It assume that the fragment ions will be present within the 2 most abundant species per window (Which is not always true especially for b ions).
2) The start of the first window of selection is fixed by the "minimum m/z" value to consider provided by the user and does not start on a specific peak that could
Improvment could be done by systematically checking the corresponding b ion for each y ion detected with b = (M+H)1+ - y + 1
and or calculating the different penultimate y ions possible with each amino acid with (M+H)1+ - AAmass = penultimate y ion and check if a corresponding peak is present in spectra to start reading from that point.


## Proportionated Venn Diagram ##
Description:
This tool provide customizable proportionated Venn diagram generation.
Alternatively the possibility to extract

Step 1:
First select if you want to compare 2 datasets (Venn dimension 2) or 3 datasets (Venn dimension 3)
You can decide to use one of these 2 options to input your values:
1) "Table file" allow to load .csv , tsv or txt (Excel will be added later) and then select the column field to compare with other sets.
2) "Manual input" allow to directly write or copy paste a list of values.
Two options for the Venn presentation are available:
1) Color, will automatically fill the different Venn region with contrasted color-blind friendly colors. Lazyprot does not provide the possibility to customize the color of each region
but allow to generate a Venn without labels to allow total freedom on figure editing for the color or label font.
2) Black and white, will generate Venn with shapes of greys for black and white printing contrast or publications limiting the number of color figures.
The labelling type (None, Numeric value, Percent and Value with Percent) and the font size selection allow to adapt the needs for a tidy Venn diagram.

Step 2:
Depending on the data input option choosen on Step 1 this window will take two forms.
1) if "Table file" is choosen, you can load a different file in each of the three loading region. To do so Press the "Load table" button.
To remove some of the file selected press "Clear all" button.
Once the file is loaded you can parse your columns by selecting to right field separator for your data (a .csv file will be "comma", a .tsv will be a "TAB" ...).
Press "Load and select the data column" to extract the different column headers then select the column index or title desired for comparison.
By default the "Remove column header" is set to "Yes" meaning that your choosen data column contains a Header descriptive value that should not be included in the comparison.
You can also set the different dataset names that will be displayed on the Venns and for the lists of unique and shared values outputed.
2) if "Manual input" is choosen a field for each dataset will be displayed.
You can fill manually or directly copy and paste from an existing table document your values to compare (WARNING: You have to fill the fields starting from the left).
You have the option to extract a particular part of your datas with regular expression extraction. To do so you can provide a start and end sequence or remarkable symbols that delimit the value you want to extract on your list of data (The two delimiters don't have to be the same). For example selecting "|" for both the starting and ending field delimiter will allow to extract the Accession number from a full protein accession by pressing "Apply" (ie: an accession such as :  >sp|P31689|DNJA1_HUMAN DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1 OS=Homo sapiens GN=DNAJA1 PE=1 SV=2  will output: P31689). WARNING: to use delimiters symbol such as ("[", "]", "*", "\") please add a "\" in the front of it (ie: to use the delimiter "\" please enter "\\").
This can be particularly usefull to extract accession numbers for subsequent Gene ontology analysis or to compare DNA or RNA sequences present between two codons or restriction enzyme sites.
Note: This extraction option can be used indepedently from the rest of the tool.

Step 3:
Once all your desired parameters are set you have to choose a folder to output you Venn figures and value lists. To do so press "Select outpout directory for unique lists and figures".
You have to option to output text files that contains list of values that are unique and shared amongst the different datasets, to activate this option select "Yes" for "Output lists of unique".
The next few options allow you to name the Venn figure file, to set the desired dpi resolution and the graphical format of your Venn figure.
By default the "Transparency" parameter is set to "Yes" which mean that your figure will be generated with a transparent background and allow to blend it on any color or gradient background.

To generate the figure and the lists, press "Start". At the same time a Preview of you outputed figure will be displayed on the "Venn Figure Preview" window without the need to browse the file in your folder. (The preview is scalled to the window size and is not representative to the full size of your generate figure).

## Combine FASTA Database ##
Description:
This tool allow to merge as many FASTA as requested together into a consensus FASTA file.
For entries with same accession number but different sequence lenght, the entry with the longest sequence will be kept.
For entries with different accessions but same sequences the first one found will be kept.
In all cases every removed sequences with corresponding descriptions will be outputed in the display window for monitoring.

Step 1:
You have to load each FASTA file individually by pressing several time the "Load FASTA files". each FASTA selected will then be added in the list window below.
You can remove a selected file or all file from the list by pressing either "Remove selected file from list" or "Clean all files from list".

Step 2:
Once all FASTA to merge are in the Step 1 list window, you can press "Output Directory" to choose a output folder with the name of your final FASTA file.
Press "START" to begin the merging process.

## Reverse Shuffle And edit FASTA Database ##
Description:
The shuffle fasta tool allow to Load, edit, and add decoy sequences in you FASTA file for subsequent analysis.
It also provide the possibility to change the lenght of sequence per line in the file to format your FASTA file for different softwares or processes compatibility (default 60 character per line).

Step 1:
Load your desired FASTA file to modify by pressing "Load FASTA File".

Step 2:
This step provide the possibility to automatically add the iRT (Biognosys) sequence in your database if your are using this particular internal calibrant in your samples.
iRT Sequence: (LGGNEQVTRYILAGVENSKGTFIIDPGGVIRGTFIIDPAAVIRGAGSSEPVTGLDAKTPVISGGPYEYRVEATFGVDESNAKTPVITGAPYEYRDGLDAASYYAPVRADVTPADFSEWSKLFLQFGAQGSPFLK)

Step 3:
This step allow the user to change the format of the FASTA by changing the header starting symbol ">" and the lenght of sequence per line (It is not recommended to change the default settings unless particular processing).
A entry window also allow the possibility to add custom sequences by the user such as recombinant proteins or particular calibrant to monitor during your analysis. The manually added sequences have to follow the FASTA general format rules (ie: A descriptive header line starting by the symbol ">" followed by accession values, gene number, species, and generic name if needed then on a new line the full protein sequence (There is no need for the user to split the sequence on multiple lines as the process will automatically do it)).
Note: The entry sequences do not have to be amino acid sequences and this tool should work for generating DNA or RNA FASTA sequences too.

At the end of the Step 3 you have to possibility to save your FASTA file at this stage without adding decoy sequences. To do so press the "Output Directory" to select your output directory and FASTA file name and press the "Start" button on the Step 3 field.

Step 4:
This field provide the possibility to modify further your FASTA file by adding decoy sequences for false discovery (FDR) calculation.
WARNING: This step should not be followed if your identification or subscequent process software already include an automatic decoy sequence generation. It is up to the user to determine this information but usually generic identification tools such as "Protein Pilot and Mascot" have automatic decoy sequences options whyle X-tandem and TPP pipeline process ask the user to add their own decoy sequences.
You can decide to generate either "Reverse" or "Shuffle" decoy sequences. ("Reverse" will generate reverted sequences for all entries in your FASTA whyle "Shuffle" will randomly shuffle the existing characters in the sequence for all entries).
You have the possibility to add a "TAG" (default "rev_") at the front of each decoy sequence description header to facilitate their discrimination when identified in your data.
Press "Output Directory" to select your output folder and FASTA name then press "Start" to generate the fully modified FASTA file.
WARNING: the outputed FASTA file name will also include the "TAG" in from of the file name (ie: if you choose "myFASTA" as output FASTA name, the generated file will be named rev_myFASTA).


## Gradient Retention time Transposition ##
Description:
This tool provide different functionality for liquid chromatography experiments:
The possibility to set, save and load gradient methods and to diplay and compare them on a graph for visual adjustment.
The possibility to set, save and load liquid chromatographic system settings such as (Column length and internal diameter, capillary length and internal diameter and flow speed) for system dead volume calculation.
Finally the possibility to integrate all these informations to transpose observed retention time of analytes (amino acid based or not) from data acquired on a LC sytem to another LC system.

Step 1:
Choose your input original data set consisting of your list of analytes with their corresponding retention times by pressing "Load file to modify" (the file can be csv, txt or excel table file).
The option to load mzML files might be added in the future to directly update your mzML file with transposed retention times but is currently inactive.
Once selected, choose a column separator and press "Load and select column" to load the different columns availbale in your file in the drop down menu. Select the column that correspond to your retention time values for your analytes.
You can also determine if your column contains a descriptive header, by selecting "Yes" this header will be removed and not consider in the subsequent analysis.

Step 2:
This gradient method window will allow you to provide informations about the gradient method used to acquired your loaded file retention times (LC system A) and the gradient method that you want your retention time to be transposed to (LC system B).
LC methods can be created and saved with "Save Gradient" to then reloaded and re-used later with "Load Gradient".
The first column (Time (min)) should contain the time of the gradient events (in minutes) and the second column the corresponding Elution solvent (B) concentration (in purcent).
To display or compare your gradients you can tick the "Plot Gradient" A AND/OR B boxes and then press "Plot Preview".
Note: this part can be used independently of the rest of the tool to generate graph comparison between gradient and elaborate your own liquid chromatography method before processing your samples.

Step 3:
This optional tool allow to factor in potential variations in the dead volume between the 2 systems to correct the impact that this parameter may have on the retention times from a system to another.
To activate this option select "Yes" for "Take in consideration LC system variables".
The LC system A fluidic settings window correspond to the fluidic parameters of the LC system used to acquire your loaded file retention times.
The LC system B fluidic settings window correspond to the fluidic parameters of the LC system you want to transpose your retention times to.
The "Column" field require the Length of your chromatographic column (in millimeter) and the column internal diameter (in millimeter).These informations should be accessible directly 
on the column packaging or via your provider website.
The "Capillary & Flow" field require the length of the capillary (in millimeter) from the output of your column to the front end of your mass spectrometer source or collecting outlet and
the capillary internal diameter (in micro meter). These informations should be accessible directly on the capillary packaging or via your provider website.
The Flow speed is also required in (micro liter per minutes).
You can save your LC system parameters with the "Save" button and reload and re-use them later with "Load".
You also have the option to display the calculation of the dead volume in your system and time delay between elution from the column and effective elution from the system. To do so press "Get void volume (uL)/ Time delay (min)".
Note: this part can be used independently of the rest of the tool to virtually create a fluidic system and evaluate its characteritics.
 
Step 4:
Once all your parameters are selected, select the output directory and file name for the updated retention times with "Output Directory" then press "Start" to launch the process.
WARNING: the outputed file will contains all the origianl file columns and add a new column with the new system predicted retention times.

How is the retention time transposition working ? 
The retention time transposition work with a graphical data interpolation, by collecting the different analytes observed retention times in the data
and calculating the coordinates of the values on the system A gradient method graph. By doing so the Y ordinate value for each coordinates will provide the elution solvent concentration
necessary to elute each analytes. By reporting these values on the system B gradient method graph it is possible to determine the corresponding coordinates on the graph and the X
abscissa values for each analytes that correlate with their estimated time of elution on the new system when the necessary elution solvent concentration is met.
WARNING: This method is far from perfect but should give a fairly good estimation of the retention time on the new system even with a non linear gradient.
Improvment could be done by allowing the addition of a pre-column trap and capillary parameters for the dead volume calculation.
Also this system requires the two LC system columns to have a similar chemistry and assume that when the right concentration of B solvent is met the analytes will elute without delay.
This assumption can be wrong with particularly long column or analytes that have a particularly strong affinity for the stationary phase.
Also if the sample complexity acquired on the first system is different from the sample acquired on the second system some analytes interaction may greatly influence their retention times.
Note: when calculating the void volume of the column, the column is not considered as an empty cylinder, in fact the column is filled with material and the volume considered should be related to the "Pore volume".
To not confuse users a Pore volume of 70% (0.70) is considered as 0.70 is the average pore volume for non-encapped, fully porous spherical bare silica support.
The column void volume is calculated by this equation: Void Volume (uL) = (Column diameter^2 * Pi * Length * Pore volume (0.7)/4) with column diamter and length in millimeter.
In the future an option to allow user to provide their own Pore volume (ex: 0.50 for superficially porous supports (fused-core, core-shell)).


## In silico Transition Library ##
Description:
This tool allow to generate ion libraries for targeted or SWATH based DIA mass spectrometry experiments without DDA data and with approximative retention time prediction.
It have the advantage to be able to generate libraries regardless of the size of the starting FASTA file and does not require to have any internal calibrant to predict the retention time.
This may be particularly usefull to complement an existing experimental library with entries that couldn't be detected with classic DDA methods due to sensitivity or stochasticity but might be present in DIA data or to quickly assess the presence or not of set of targets in DIA data with no preliminary DDA data.
This tool is designed in a way that process the library generation on a step by step basis allowing the user to monitor the number of Proteins and peptides left after each filtering steps thus allowing the adjustment of the parameters on the flight.

Step 1:
Choose your input .fasta proteine sequence file to generate library transitions for.

Step 2:
At this step you can choose your desired enzymatic digestion for peptide generation (the selected enzyme should be the one your are planning to process your sample for DIA or SWATH analysis). At the moment four options are available (Trypsin, Chymotrypsin, GluC (phosphate buffer), GluC (bicarbonate buffer)).
Tryspin option cuts sequences after 'K' or 'R' if next amino acid is not 'P', Chymotrypsin cuts after 'F', 'Y', 'L', 'W' if next amino acid is not 'P'.
For GluC enzyme depending if your proteins are in a phosphate based buffer (such as PBS) the sequence cutting is set to cut after 'D' or 'E' if next amino acid is not 'P'.
if your proteins are in bicarbonate based buffer (such as ammonium bicarbonate) the sequence cutting is set to cut after 'E' if next amino acid is not 'P'.
Once you have selected your enzyme by default one missed cleavage will be considered (this option can be set to zero).
WARNING: You need to press the "Start Digest" button before processing the next step. The protein sequences will be digested following the selected parameters and the number of proteins and peptides considered in the library will be displayed. Also peptides that contains unusual amino acid codes such as ("B", "J", "O", "U", "X", "Z") will be automatically removed.
For the precursor mass calculation the algorithm include the following modifications (carbamidomethylation of cysteines (mass abduct of 57.021464 before m/z calculation ) and oxydation of Methionines (mass abduct of 15.994915 before m/z calculation)).

Step 3:
This step allow to remove from the library the peptides that can be found with the exact same sequence in more than one protein in the .fasta file.
This is recommended to avoid the possibility to consider and quantify false positive proteins.
WARNING: You need to press the "Apply Filter" button before processing to the next step. Shared peptides will be removed and the number of proteins and peptides considered in the library will be displayed.
Note: This step is optional, if you do not want to apply it, select the "No" option on the left and jump directly to the next step.

Step 4:
This step allow to apply a peptide length filter for the peptide to be kept in the library.
This is particularly usefull to avoid cluttering your library with peptides that may be too short to give enough transitions for a valid evaluation or too long to flight properly or give a good fragmentation spectra in your mass spectrometer (these values are subjective and need to be carefully considered based on your mass spectrometry system).
WARNING: by default this filtering is turned off, if you want to apply this filter select "Yes" then press the "Apply filter" button. Otherwise just press "Apply filter" and jump to the next step.

Step 5:
This step provide the possibility to generate predicted retention times for your library peptides that will fit with your gradient method.
WARNING: To perform this step you need to do a DDA acquisition on any sample that you have available (The sample does not have to be necessarly from the same organism) using the exact same column chemistry, flow speed and gradient method that you are planning to use on your DIA acquisition. The raw data have to be analysed with your protein identification algorithm of choice with the corresponding .fasta protein database to generate a list of peptide identified in your sample of choice (The file can be any type of readable format that contains at least a column with the peptide sequences, a column with their retention times and a column with identified modifications on the peptide). This peptide list will be used as a training dataset to calibrate the retention time prediction algorithm. The advantage of that is once acquired you can re use the same training dataset as long as liquid chromatography method remain the same regardless of the origin of the sample.
Note: This step is optional, to apply the retention time prediction select "Yes" on the left then press the "Load Peptide DDA File" before providing the other settings on this step.
After loading your peptide training file, select the file column delimiter (comma, TAB or space based separation) then press the "Load Column Headers". Based on your selected column separator
the diffrent column headers in your file will be available from three drop down menu. Select for each of these the corresponding column for "Peptide sequences column", "Retention times column" and "Peptide modifications column".
An option is available to exclude from the training set, peptides that are out of a retention time window. This parameter can be particularly usefull to avoid training the retention time prediction with irrelevant retention times coming from peptides eluting during the wash steps. (it is recommended to set minimum and maximum retention time values correspond to your effective separation gradient). To turn ON this option, select "Yes" on the left side and select your minimum and maximum retention (in minutes) to consider in the training.

Step 6:
This is the step that finalize your ion library generation.
Select an output directory and library file name by pressing the "Output Direstory" button. Select the different potential charge states to consider for each peptides (2+, 2+ and 3+ or 2+, 3+ and 4+).
WARNING: considering multiple charge state will significantly increase the number of entries in your library and will significantly increase the calculation time.
An extra option is available to generate transitions for (b, y or both ion series) and to remove the first ions of the serie up to the third one. This option is usefull if you want to restrict your library to ions that have the best chances to give a quantificable signal (The first few ions are usually in the low mass end with potential significant interferences).
Select an library format to be directly compatible with well known processing softwares for the interrogation of your DIA data. (Skyline and Peakview format are available, Spectronaut format is not yet included).
Finnaly press the "Start" button and wait until a Transition generated is outputed or until the Processing log display "Done!"
WARNING: The time necessary to complete the process may greatly variate depending on the number of processors available on your machine and the original size of the .fasta file and parameters selected
up to several minutes.


How is the retention time prediction working?
Basically once the Peptide precursors are generated from the available FASTA sequences, the algorithm uses a pyteomics package called "achrom" [1] that correlate the peptide sequences to their respective retention times on a system by using an additive model of polypeptide chromatography where a set of retention coefficients are calculated by drawing a best fit line describing the main trend between a training set of Peptides (considering the individual coefficient for all amino acid residues in the peptides) and their known retention times.
This retention coefficient can then be used to estimate unknown retention times for peptide sequences with a reasonale margin of error assuming that the predicted retention times for the peptide of interest will fit the trained model.
This method have the advantage to be very simple and more importantly quick to apply on a large dataset but suffers from a major drawback, it is not sequence-specific and two peptides with different sequences but the same amico acid composition will have the same retention time [2, 3].
To compensate few improvments were added to the model with the logarithmic length correction term [4] and the addition of a set of retention coefficient for terminal amino acid residues [5].
