## How to use Lazyprot ##

No Installation is necessary to use Lazyprot as all dependencies and scripts are embedded in a stand-alone. :wink:
In most cases this program should also work directly from a hard drive or USB for portability.

Just download the Lazyprot ".zip" and extract it

### Launch by double clicking ###

There you should find  a file called "LazyProt_mainGUI_portable.exe", just double click it.
For ease of use you can right clic and create a shortcut to the executable to place anywhere
for macOS right clic and use "Alias"
##### WARNING !! #####
For macOS users, depending on your security options you may not see the "LazyProt_mainGUI_portable" file as executable but as a text file or getting warning about the software being a third part app and not being able to run it. In that case you need to make the file executable following the procedure below:
1) Open your Terminal.app (in Applications > Utilities)

```
chmod +x 
```

Press enter
4) Right clic the LazyProt_mainGUI_portable file and select "Open" then select "Open to the next warning window"
You might see some warnings about virtualenvwrapper, please disregard them the software should open just fine after few seconds.
